This is how to use EasyEmail.

Don't delete the apostrophes.

Under the # Users text, you can modify the sender email and the sender name.
We suggest to change the email to a user which has less secure app usage
turned on. The sender name can be whatever you want.

The receiver emails, can be modified as well. Make sure the emails you chose
actually exist.

Under the # Email text, please change the location to a folder on your desktop.

The email body can be modified to whatever you want. 

Under the # Attachment text, you can specify a file which is in the folder you specified.

Under the # Email information text, you can change the subject. You may remove the
'+ receiver_name' text as well.

If you have some background information about Python, you can modify any part of the
script besides the parts which encode the attachments or send the email.

Thank you.
